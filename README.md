# Krakfot 2

This is intended to be the successor to [krakfot](https://github.com/TomasKindahl/krakfot), which is intended to become a GUI motor, with a similar application as MAUI, Electron and Flutter, but not with web, because JS and CSS are not good stuff.

The good thing about krakfot is that it implements a stroke font. The bad thing is that it uses display lists, which are obsoleted and replaced with [vertex buffer objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_buffer_object).
